# Zomato Restaurants EDA Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato Restaurants Dataset to gain insights into the restaurant industry.

## Problem Statement

The restaurant industry is dynamic, and understanding key trends can help businesses and enthusiasts make informed decisions. This project aims to explore the Zomato dataset to answer questions such as:

- Which cuisines are most popular?
- How do ratings vary by country?
- Which cities have the most restaurants?
- Is there a relationship between price and ratings?
- Which restaurant types dominate the market?
